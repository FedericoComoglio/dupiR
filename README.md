##dupiR is an R package for Bayesian inference using discrete uniform priors. 

This package implements a Bayesian approach to infer population sizes from count data. The package takes a set of sample counts obtained by sampling fractions of a finite volume containing an homogeneously dispersed population of identical objects and returns the posterior probability distribution of the population size. The algorithm makes use of a binomial likelihood and non-conjugate, discrete uniform priors. dupiR can be applied to both sampling with or without replacement.

dupiR has been developed by Federico Comoglio (ETH Zurich) and Maurizio Rinaldi (University of Piemonte Orientale). This GitHub repository contains a first release of the package and will accommodate subsequent updates. We welcome external contributions.
